# Summary of Google OAuth Fixes

We've made several changes to improve the Google OAuth implementation for both local development and production environments. Here's a summary of what was fixed:

## 1. Consistent Redirect URLs

- Updated `GoogleSignInButton.tsx` to use a consistent approach to redirect URLs, ensuring they match what's configured in Google Cloud Console
- Added support for both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` in redirect configurations

## 2. Better Session Management

- Enhanced `callback/page.tsx` to include better error handling and debugging
- Added redundant session storage methods (cookies + localStorage) to ensure session persistence
- Changed cookie settings for better compatibility across browsers and environments

## 3. Cookie Configuration

- Changed cookie settings from `sameSite: 'strict'` to `sameSite: 'lax'` for better compatibility in local environments
- Set `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to ensure cookies work on HTTP in development
- Added detailed error messages and logging to help troubleshoot issues

## 4. Local Supabase Configuration

- Created `supabase/config.toml` with appropriate settings for local Google OAuth:
  - Set `skip_nonce_check = true` which is essential for local development
  - Added multiple redirect URLs including patterns with wildcards (`**`)
  - Ensured environment variables are correctly referenced

## 5. Google One Tap Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in the One Tap component
- Added state tracking to prevent re-initialization issues
- Improved user feedback when errors occur

## 6. Middleware Enhancements

- Improved token validation logic in middleware
- Added better logging for debugging
- Optimized token refresh to only happen when needed

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. Make sure your Google Cloud Console project has all the correct redirect URLs configured:
   - `http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Production equivalents

2. Ensure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SUPABASE_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SUPABASE_AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`

3. For local development, ensure you have Supabase running locally with the correct configuration

4. Test the sign-in flow to ensure it's working properly
